## 1. what is memory management in system programming?
-  Memory management is the process of allocating, organizing, and freeing memory so that programs can run efficiently without conflicts or crashes.

## 2. what is virtual memory?
-  Virtual memory is an OS technique that allows a program to use more memory than physically available by using RAM + disk, providing protection, isolation, and flexibility.

## 3. Difference between virtual memory and cache memory?
- Virtual memory = OS technique to extend available memory using disk + RAM.
- Cache memory = Hardware technique to speed up CPU access to frequently used data.

##4. Differentiate between physical memory and virtual memory.
- Physical memory = actual RAM
- Virtual memory = extension of RAM using disk space

##5. What is the role of an operating system in memory management?
- The Operating System (OS) plays a crucial role in memory management by efficiently handling how memory is allocated, used, and freed during program execution.
- Role of an Operating System in Memory Management,
-     - Memory Allocation and Deallocation
      - Address Translation (Mapping Virtual to Physical Memory)
      - Protection and Isolation
      - Sharing of Memory
      - Swapping / Paging
      - Memory Organization
      - Monitoring and Optimization
      - Handling FragTo Enable Multitaskingmentation

##6. Explain the purpose of memory allocation.
- The purpose of memory allocation is to ensure that programs get the memory they need to run efficiently and safely.
- Purpose of Memory Allocation,
-     - To Assign Memory to Programs
      - To Ensure Safe and Organized Memory Use
      - To Utilize Memory Efficiently
      - To Support Dynamic Memory Needs
      - To Enable Multitasking
      - To Support Virtual Memory

##7. Describe the significance of memory deallocation.
